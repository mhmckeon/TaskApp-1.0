**Introduction:**
Welcome to the Goal Time Tracker, a simple Java application designed for tracking time spent working towards your goals.

**Project Description:**
This Java application is built for tracking progress towards personal goals. The data is efficiently stored using SQLite, ensuring seamless data management.

**Usage Instructions:**
- A new database is created upon opening the tracker.
- To add a goal, use the "add" command and provide a name.
- To delete a goal, use the "del" command followed by the goal's ID.
- To start tracking time for a goal, use the "S" command and specify the goal ID.
- To stop tracking time for a goal, use the "D" command and specify the goal ID.
- Goals that are still open when quitting the app will be automatically finished.

**Future Enhancements:**
In the future, the application will display a detailed history of time spent on each goal, providing users with valuable insights into their progress over time.
