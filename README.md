<h1>Goal Time Tracker</h1>
<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p>This is a simple Java application for tracking time spent working towards goals. It was made with the goal of learning the basics of Java before heading into my second semester in UCD. Data is stored using SQLite.</p>
<p>The app allows for adding and deleting goals, as well as adding time spent on a goal. Each segment of time spent on a goal is added with the duration and date stamp. In future, these will be displayable for each goal.</p>

<h2>Using the Tracker.</h2>
<p>A new database will be created on opening the tracker. Add any goals when prompted, using "add" and then giving a name. It will be automatically asigned a goal ID. To start tracking time for a goal, use "S" and type the ID when prompted. To stop, type "D" and the ID when prompted. Any goals still open when quitting the app will be automatically finished.</p>
